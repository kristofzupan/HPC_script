Hello. ,Social
My assumption is,Seminar
that the emphasis on barbarism implies that she sent him to the lion.,Seminar
I agree with Cassandra's noticing ,Seminar
of the author's word choice of barbarism.,Seminar
I loved the addition of ,Seminar
"Her lover would die and never love another."" ",Seminar
" Sadly  the barbaric nature of the king and princess is still alive today in crimes of passion.""",Seminar
Submitted,Procedure
"If the princess possesses the same semi-barbaric trait as her father, then it would seem she directed her lover to the door with the tiger. ",Seminar
"Either way she must love without him, but is she open-hearted enough to allow for him to love another?",Seminar
"It doesn't appear so. For instance, she discloses great agony, jealousy, and stress about the potential wedding between her lover and the lady behind the door;",Seminar
"however, she only comments that a tiger would bring shrieks and blood. From her revealed thoughts, she is ",Seminar
mor,
"more upset with the prospect of him belonging to another, and so it is clear,",Seminar
"given the two terrible choices,",Seminar
she would send him to his death.,Seminar
If the King were to discover that his daughter broke the law by secretly sending her lover towards the door on the right,Seminar
he would have to send his daughter to the arena for a judgement. ,Seminar
"I would imagine,",Seminar
"given that it is stressed he is semi-barbaric, he would choose not to send his daughter, whom he loves so dearly, to her potential death.",Seminar
"However, I also do not",Seminar
ima,Seminar
imagine this to be the catalyst that ends his idea of public punishment. ,Seminar
"Perhaps, instead of sending his daughter to the arena, he would send the person who gave her the information about the two doors instead.",Seminar
 It could be argued that the informant is more guilty than the princess and is sent to show the kingdom the consequence of such behaviors.,Seminar
"(Sorry it came out as three separate messages! For some reason, it wouldn't post my full response at once.)",Seminar
I agree with Ashely ,Seminar
 that the Princess's barbaric traits will lead the princess to send her lover to his death.,Seminar
"She exhibits immaturity and cruelty by fixating on imagined flirtations between ""the lady"" and the princess's lover.",Seminar
The story also leads me to think that she is accustomed to having her every wish granted by her father and that she never learned the benefits of compassion.,Seminar
I also agree with Ashley,Seminar
that the king's adoration of his daughter would stop him from sending his daughter into the arena.,Seminar
"I had orgininally thought that the king would either keep her secret out of love for his daughter, or out of barbaric pride that she sent her lover to his grizzly death, or a combination of the two. ",Seminar
"If the secret was shared with the community, I also think that it would be her informant that would be punished.",Seminar
I had not considered Ashley's idea that this experience might be an ,Seminar
opportun,Seminar
I had not considered Ashley's idea that this experience might be an opportunity for the king to re-examine the practice.,Seminar
 I like this idea!,Seminar
"The more I think about this activity, the more I wonder if we are supposed to be collaboratively writing an end to the story. ",Deliberation
Perhaps the top of this page (where we type and send messages) is for planning and the bottom (open white area) is for writing an end to the story? ,UX
I'm overall a little confused by this entire module ,Deliberation
and am open to other thoughts/suggestions.,Deliberation
"I think you are correct, Ashley. ",Deliberation
"I thought we could all answer the questions in the messaging area (like you & I did), then we can take turns drafting a group response",UX
"I could write the first draft based on my interpretation of our answers, then we could take turns editing - round robin style until we are happy with the result",Deliberation
What were your thoughts?,Deliberation
"That sounds great, Meg! ",Social
Thanks for taking the lead on the first draft,Social
I‚Äôll check in soon and add to it ,Procedure
üëç,Social
SUBMITTED,Procedure
I am late to the discussion ,Procedure
but I figured I might as well add to this,Procedure
because while I agree with the first part said,Seminar
" I have to say, the line of thinking is still technically flawed.",Seminar
Just because she comes from a semi-barbaric King does not make her semi-barbaric. ,Seminar
Love does have a way of changing how we think and make valuable decisions like this one,Seminar
"While Jealousy is a strong determinate, Love is often stronger, and it would make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make",Seminar
s,
make sense to allow her lover to live out of love just as much as it would make sense for her to have him killed. ,Seminar
Basing a decision on her lineage is not exactly a strong source in my opinion.,Seminar
"However, basing a decision on her own thought process, that I can get behind",Seminar
and Meg brought and interesting topic of the difference between how the princess rambles on about him opening the door with the lady but barely mentions him opening the door with the tiger.,Seminar
The princess has no qualms about her lover dying but,Seminar
had great grief over her lover in another‚Äôs arms.,Seminar
"As for the second part, only her lover saw her give the signal so the second part is questionable as it would be based on hearsay. ",Seminar
 Would the king even entertain that idea given it is his daughter?,Seminar
Who knows? ,Seminar
"Without someone seeing her give the signal, they really cannot accuse her of helping him",Seminar
"Not to mention that if she had not helped him at all, and he opened the door with the female, would she still be under scrutiny?",Seminar
What would happen then?,Seminar
uwgyeu,
"Part 1: For this question, our team decided that the princess chose the door with the tiger. ",Seminar
"This is based on the story's emphasis on the royal family's semi barbaric"" nature.",Seminar
" In the story  it is mentioned several times that the princess is jealous of the idea of her lover being with another woman  stating ""her soul had burned in agony when he rushed to meet that woman"" (pp. 10).",Seminar
This action seems indicitive of her barbaric and jealous nature because this way she remains the conquerer  and if she cannot,Seminar
"ha""",
What do you guys think? ,Seminar
Do you think that she kills him or saves him?,Seminar
What would you do in her place?,Imaginative Entry
"I kind of think that even though she is angry and jealous, she would ultimately save him. ",Seminar
I think that overall the weight of her conscious would have kept her from sending him to his death for falling in love with her.,Seminar
"After all, it is a two way road and she is being punished right along with him for getting caught by the king as well.",Seminar
 I also think that even if the king finds out that she knew the doors he will know that either choice that she makes is a punishment in its own right. She suffers either way ,Seminar
w,
And what if the king already knew that she had broken the law. ,Seminar
Perhaps he planned it so that she would be the one to make the decision in the end as no one has ever known what's behind the doors before,Seminar
Maybe this was her punishment.,Seminar
"Knowing she could save him from death, but still lose him in the end.",Seminar
It would be just a thing that this King would do I think.,Seminar
"Kyra, those are some good thoughts! ",Seminar
I'm kind of on the fence about whether she saves him or not.,Seminar
 I think that she may dislike the idea that he marries another more than him dying.,Seminar
So I'm leaning more toward she sends him to the tiger's door.,Seminar
But I do also think that it is possible that the King could be in on it too. ,Seminar
He could know that she knows which door is which and he seems like the type of king to enjoy that punishment,Seminar
Emilie I can see that. ,Seminar
"Not what do you think she would do, but what would you do if you were in the situation? ",Imaginative Entry
I know I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew I was the reason the person I loved was killed in such a painful manner,Imaginative Entry
 It would hurt worse to know his death was my fault than to know that he was happy with someone else. ,Imaginative Entry
I think I'd find it easier to move on and live if he was still alive.,Imaginative Entry
I mean there are other guys out there after all.,Imaginative Entry
I agree.,Imaginative Entry
" Personally, I would save him. ",Imaginative Entry
"I'd rather be sad for a little while that the person I loved married someone else, than let them get killed. ",Imaginative Entry
I would feel guilty for the rest of my life.,Imaginative Entry
And that's true! ,Imaginative Entry
"There are other guys out there so even if he was the most handsome and all that,",Imaginative Entry
I'm sure I would eventually get over him being with someone else,Imaginative Entry
"I think if I misled him to choose the tiger's door, I would feel like I committed a murder myself",Imaginative Entry
I agree with that so much! ,Imaginative Entry
But I'm not sure how this princess would think.,Seminar
Do we know how many people are part of this group? ,Procedure
We can try to get in touch with them and decide how we wat to write out the answer,Procedure
I'm not sure! ,Procedure
"I tried looking for a ""particpants"" button or something and I couldn't find one.",Procedure
I couldn't either.,Procedure
"I sent an email to the coordinator and I hope to hear back from them, but I wouldn't mind setting up a discussion in our class page too",Procedure
You're here for LIS6303 or for another class?,Procedure
I'm also in LIS6303!,Procedure
okay awesome! ,Procedure
I'm going to create a discussion called Book Club 4 and see if we can see if there is anyone else who is part of that group.,Procedure
Good idea!,Social
So how do you guys think we should end it?,Deliberation
"I'm honestly okay with either ending, ",Deliberation
but I think we should incorporate the King mentioning that he helped feed his daughter the information on what was behind each door. ,Seminar
That's just my opinion though.,Seminar
"Also, I got an email letting us know that Elias Royal is also a part of our group. ",Procedure
I want to wait to see what they think about how the ending should go as well.,Seminar
"How do you think it should end, Emilie?",Seminar
"Of course, we should all definitely have a chance to contribute.",Procedure
I'm also okay with either ending for Part 1 as well. ,Seminar
My initial thoughts were that the princess knows what's behind each of the doors because the King had told her or she figured it out from overhearing him talk about the punishment.,Seminar
"I also got the sense that she would point her lover to the tiger's door, but now the more that I think about it, I think she would send him to the other woman.",Seminar
I liked what you mentioned earlier Kyra,Seminar
about how she may have felt guilty.,Seminar
"As for Part 2, I have a theory. ",Seminar
"I think that when the King discovers his daughter broke the law, he would still make her go through the arena.",Seminar
"BUT, he'd tell her which door leads to a man and which leads to the tiger, thinking that she will obviously choose to marry and live.",Seminar
"HOWEVER, she is so distraught about losing the love of her life that she actually chooses the tiger's door on purpose.",Seminar
This could either cause the King to become even more barbaric or to stop these trials all together,Seminar
But that's just what I was thinking.,Seminar
 I'm definitely okay with another approach that we can all agree on,Seminar
Oooo I like that idea of how he might send her to the arena and then tell her which is behind each door. ,Seminar
"This gives her a chance at potential happiness or, if she is feeling miserable and depressed, may want to go through with the tiger!",Seminar
That's certainly an interesting way to look at the potential of that kind of ending.,Seminar
And I almost think if we can't decide we might just flip a coin ,Seminar
lol ,Social
(I've been playing dnd too much and it has influenced my writing),Social
Or we could take turns writing out a paragraph and jump one it from the last person's response.,Deliberation
"Flipping a coin may not be the worst idea, honestly! ",Deliberation
I like the idea of writing a paragraph or a few sentences and then bouncing off from there. ,Deliberation
That's fun,Social
Glad you like that idea ,Social
:D,Social
I think it would be fun too!,Social
"Oooo I have another idea! What if the princess sends the man to the tiger and right out tells her father she did it and wants a trial. Then because he loves her he begs her to choose the door with the young man he picks for her, but she chooses the tiger.",Seminar
That's a creative idea!,Seminar
 I like it,Seminar
"Kyra, I LOVE what you did for part 1!! ",Social
That's some amazing writing! ,Social
Let's hope I do as well on part 2!!,Social
Awww thank you so much!,Social
Ahhh I love your response too!,Social
Finished! How does that sound?,Seminar
it's wonderful!,Seminar
Any idea on how to submit it?,UX
I think we just leave it here? I'm not totally sure,UX
Yeah I was wondering because when I click 'My Answer' at the top it says I haven't submitted one. ,UX
So I don't know. ,UX
Maybe sometime next week there will be a button to push.,UX
Maybe! ,UX
Or when the survey comes out maybe something will be there,UX
Yeah that makes sense.,UX
darla,
"Part 1: Ultimately, it is left for the reader to decide what is behind the door,",Seminar
and it would depend what they feel the princess cares about more - his life or him being married to another woman.,Seminar
He sentences her to the same trial.,Seminar
Part 1: It is such an agonizing question of whether the lady or the tiger is behind the door. ,Seminar
 The abyss of pain and betrayal of an unfaithful lover and seeing them with someone else is palpable and I could imagine that in the throngs of that deep pain one might wish their unfaithful lover to be dead.,Seminar
I would hope though,Seminar
"that the lady is behind the door; that the princess might be able to also feel that to take another human life, even when that life has so greatly wronged you, is far worse than to ",Seminar
experien,Seminar
"^Gina, that is a really interesting point that you make, ",Seminar
that he sentences the princess to the same trial that he is on. ,Seminar
"The text describes the anxiety of being in a huge stadium with a roaring crowd and the fear of being killed horribly by a tiger, ",Seminar
"but at the same time, as you stated, the princess is herself in a greater trial than the man in that she has to decide whether to kill or not kill her lover who has hurt so deeply.",Seminar
"That's a really insightful point, Gina!",Seminar
I hadn't thought of when I read the piece,Seminar
"Hi John, ",Social
"I feel that it would be fitting for the king to sentence her to the same trial, because they king and princess are both constantly described as semi-barbaric"" throughout the text.",Seminar
"There seems to be very little compassion or empathy displayed by the king or the princess  even when the princess thinks of her lover  she thinks of herself not necessarily him.""",Seminar
"I think the lady is behind the door. If she truly loved him as the story seems to claim, she would not have wanted him mauled. Plus, if she wants a future with any man she wouldn‚Äôt want the world to see her first lover as someone who deserved to be punished.",Seminar
I honestly don‚Äôt think the king would have done anything after discovering his daughter broke the law. He probably covered it up or considered her already punished through her lovers fate.,Seminar
"I think the lady is behind the door. Regardless of how jealous you may be, you can't really love someone and also be able to tolerate watching them get torn apart by a wild animal.",Seminar
The King does seem unstable enough to put his daughter on trial via the lady and the tiger method. I imagine she'd use her own connections to find out which door had the tiger behind it and which door had a suitor.,Seminar
"I think the tiger was behind the door. Mostly because of the princess being described as ""hot-blooded and semi-barbaric.""",Seminar
"Louise Campbell, I agree with you in thinking that the king covered it up somehow and didn't put her through the trial.",Seminar
"Anna Jones, this is what I was thinking. If you really loved him you wouldn‚Äôt allow that. Alexandra, I was leaning toward the tiger at first because of the descriptions you gave. The apple doesn‚Äôt fall far from the tree and all that. üôÇ",Seminar
"Yeah, I was going back and forth a lot on what I think happened. So I can definitely see your reasoning for her picking the lady.",Seminar
"So, where have we landed: Lady or tiger? Trial or coverup? I think we just have to write something in the space below.",Others
Should we go with the choices that have a majority? So the lady behind the door and the king covering up for his daughter?,Deliberation
"Is the response we write in the field below supposed to be in the same style of the story, like we're completing it? Or are we just answering the questions?",Deliberation
I'm good with writing the majority choices.,Deliberation
"Unfortunately I can't click in the box below at all, so it's anyone's guess what style our response is supposed to be in. I would imagine answering the questions simply would be fine.",UX
"Oh good! I can, in fact, click in the box.",UX
Great!,UX
Looks good. I think to mark our assignment done we just have to write SUBMITTED at the top of the entry.,UX
Are we ready for that?,Deliberation
"Yeah, I'm good with it.",Deliberation
She gifted him with the tiger.,Seminar
I think she may not trust him enough to give him the door with the lady behind it. They really focused on her jealousy and how she's a lot like her father.,Seminar
She's definitely her father's child.,Seminar
"I think the King would offer her the same choice between the two doors, he seems to really like this punishment.",Seminar
I agree,Seminar
Could she be fed to the tiger and save the unsuspecting poor fool?,Seminar
The king fed his daughter to the tiger,Seminar
The Lady was behind the door.,Seminar
"I want to believe the tiger was behind the door because the princess was semi-barbaric but she was also filled with despair and jealousy.  The green eyed monster.. gets you every time...so she knows she has lost him, but she doesn't have to let the Lady have him.",Seminar
"I think it would depend on how much she truly trust her lover. If she had faith in him truly, she would let him live with the lady. At least he would be alive and happy. But if she was full of distrust or jealousy she would kill her lover. Even if she is semi-barbaric she seems to be fair or at least a follower of her Father. I would say she would point to the Lady in the end.",Seminar
"Interesting Jennifer Gonzalez that I initially thought the Tiger because of her jealousy and that if she could not have him, then no one could have him. But, I changed my mind with the hope of a happier ending.",Seminar
"I believe the lady was behind the door as the description of the princess was ""semi-barbaric."" She could probably have the new couple banished from the kingdom so she would not have to see them. I believe it was the tiger because the princess could not bear for anyone else to have him.",Seminar
"Upon discovering his daughter has broken the law, the King responds out of love, because she is the apple of his eye, and he forgives her.",Seminar
"Karen Richardson,",Seminar
I agree that the princess could just banish the new couple away too. Do we have to agree on a single ending?,Others
I don't think we have to agree on a single ending as both are viable. I still will go with the Lady as being behind the curtain. The King will be upset with this but will forgive his daughter. He may do something else to the boyfriend later.,Seminar
"So the King would come back at the boyfriend later due to him ""cheating"" the trial? I can see that.",Seminar
I agree he will forgive his daughter because he loves her so.,Seminar
Wait how do we submit this assignment?,Deliberation
The four questions,Deliberation
Do we answer these before continuing the story?,Deliberation
"So the top is for chatting and the bottom is for responding, I believe.",Deliberation
Yes so what do you think guys?,Deliberation
Yes I found this by luck...LOL!,Deliberation
"Ok, I had to reset the book to make this work!",Deliberation
Yay you got it!,Others
"Live without was the first one I put.  Then Trust, Love, and then Know",Deliberation
"Yep, so what you think the questions are?",Deliberation
she was smiling by the end and the book told me i did well,Deliberation
Which questions? like the prompt?,Deliberation
Live Without Him is probably the most important question,Deliberation
But it asked for 4 so i amswered with 4,Deliberation
We need total four answers to the question,Deliberation
"Oh I see, there are two questions here.  I feel that the princess would have led him to the tiger",Others
ok,Deliberation
I feel like it would be the opposite because she went to all the hassle to find out.,Seminar
"At the top of the screen are two questions, I believe that is what the 1 & 2 are on the bottom portion",Deliberation
"That is a good point, Victoria",Seminar
I tried the ones you mentioned it said try again.,Deliberation
You have to do them one at a time,Deliberation
I tried them all at once and it told me wrong lol,Deliberation
The second question here is just as complex for different reasons,Seminar
I am under the impression that she would rather see him dead than in the arms of another woman.,Seminar
me too. It said wrong!,Deliberation
there is a wrong answer?  thats weird,Deliberation
I'm try again.,Deliberation
ok!,Deliberation
It is wrong because they want the character to respond to each question one at a time.,UX
ooooh,UX
As for the second question I believe that the king would try to cover up the fact she broke the law. I only say that because if he was that mad because someone was her lover I doubt he would send her to die. He would probably rather punish her in private.,Seminar
that sounds reasonable,Seminar
Should we write it as continuing the story or just as a normal response?,Deliberation
we should keep it simple,Deliberation
Any additions?,Deliberation
keeping one's orbs in line is essential,Seminar
i think weve got it,Deliberation
Hey guys I got through the next page,Deliberation
or maybe he put her behind one of the doors!,Seminar
it's I know I live without him final question,Seminar
Oh that would be a good punishment for her!,Seminar
Did you guys get the final question,Deliberation
I know live without him,Deliberation
im just back at the screen we were at before,UX
I'm not sure what you mean by the final question. Once I put in the 4 questions it let me finish reading the last two pages.,UX
and then it just seems to end,UX
"Does anyone have any idea how to ""add the title SUBMITTED"" to our response?",UX
i do not,UX
I was looking for that,UX
Also feel free to add anything to them if you would like.,Deliberation
What did you have to do?,Deliberation
I just added a title submitted so I guess we're done. This was very interesting and challenging.,Deliberation
lol well ok then. Nice work team,Deliberation
Don't forget we have to go on to canvas and complete the survey and submit it,Deliberation
Thank you team!  Nice collab!,Social
"Sounds good, I am going to get off of here.",Social
Nice work team,Social
have a great evening!,Social
Me too goodnight! Thanks guys!,Social
"I think the tiger is behind the door, as it would create a plot twist when its not the predictable lady. The king may show mercy towards his daughter, as she is royalty. Instead, she might have to go on a quest of some kind to prove her worth to inherit the thrown one day.",Seminar
"I agree with you, Diane Gonzalez. I am convinced that the princess lead the gentleman to the door hiding the tiger. It would make a brilliant plot twist, but with the information we know about the character of the King, that can be found within the princess as well. In my mind she believes if she can't have the man, she sure does not want another woman to have him, especially someone she despises.",Seminar
"As for the second part, I'm not sure if the King would carry out the same punishment for his daughter as he would the commoners. However, he would definitely think of another way to punish her that would consist of a clever, yet barbaric twist for her to prove her loyalty and worth.",Seminar
"Hi Diane Gonzalez and Deborah Evans. I'm sorry to be so late joining the conversation. If I ponder too long, I'll never come to a conclusion, so I'm going to write my first thoughts. I share your  he's barbaric, and he's fine doling out punishment to his own daughter, as his punishment of her lover has in effect punished her as well. take that the princess will direct the gentleman to the tiger - she's lost him either way and her jealousy and barbarism are too great. On the other hand, the text describes her and the gentleman as having one soul, which I take to mean he would know if she chose the tiger, in which case he'd choose the other door, yet he doesn't. So does that mean she didn't choose the tiger? Or that he'd rather die than be with another woman? For Part 2, I believe the king likely would not show mercy, even to his own daughter, as he has consistently relied on this method of justice",Seminar
"We can continue to discuss individually, or if you want to try writing collaboratively at the same time, please suggest a time. I'm available any evening this week starting at 6 p.m. I'll keep tabs on here from now on to see if you want to do that. Thanks, Robyn",Procedure
"Curiosity got the best of me, and I googled this book, which I'd never heard of despite it being a well-known allegory. It presents an unsolvable problem, yet we all felt pretty confident taking a stab at answering the prompts. I wonder what we are to make of all of us feeling pretty certain the princess chose the tiger. Is our choice based on the author's characterization of her or our belief that human nature is fundamentally selfish?",Seminar
I don't think I should have gone outside this platform to Google the book since this is supposed to be a discussion between us via this platform. Sorry about that.,Deliberation
"Cheryl Diaz, you bring up a good point - are we truly using the information gained through the reading or our own beliefs that human nature is fundamentally selfish. You really have me thinking about this.",Seminar
"Since we have each answered the two questions that were proposed, maybe choosing a day/time to all discuss our final answer to the prompt would be best. I am pretty flexible and am available today-thursday just about all day.",Procedure
"Dr. Austin said have fun with it, and it is fun to ponder what might happen in the story. I think the main reason for setting a time to discuss it at the same time would be to test the collaborative software, using the box below instead of this one. I believe we could all write in it at the same time and see each other typing and change each other's words until we all agree we are done with our assessment. If we are able to do that, we might find there are unexpected positives or negatives to the collaboration process or system that we can only otherwise surmise. As you say, we've all responded to the prompts, so what we say doesn't matter that much, so all we'd need is a few minutes to see how using the box works. So if you want to try meeting, I could do Wednesday any time of day. Just set a time and I'll log on then. Thanks.",Procedure

Good morning,Social
"Hi. I'm not sure if we were supposed to ultimately write an ending to the story or just answer the prompts collectively. I wrote an ending below, and you can change it or replace it. We just want to test the use of the space at the same time, I think.",Procedure

Good luck to you as well,Social
Yes. Thanks. Bye!,Social
I  think she sends him to the door with the tiger. When the king finds out that she knew he is so pleased by her barbarism that he does nothing but inside he has now decided that she is a worthy predecessor.,Seminar
"Ha, I meant successor.",Seminar
"I believe she tells him to open the door with the tiger. This isn't a question of whether or not she loves him, or even trusts him. It's clearly written that she loves him dearly, and his trustworthiness isn't something to consider so heavily since she will lose him heavily. I think she points him to the tiger because of how much more thought she put into the aftermath of sending him towards the lady. She laments on how horrifying it would be to watch her loved one die at the hands of ferocity, but laments even more at the thought of watching him live a different life with someone other than her. She even gives his death a hopeful spin, that they may meet again in the afterlife or some equivalent, but gives no optimistic spin to him choosing the lady, she even mentions the whole if she can't have him no one can.""""",Seminar
since she will lose him anyway*,Seminar
"I agree with you ladies. I also think that she sends him to the tiger. She loves him fiercely, so fiercely that she cannot bear the thought of someone else having him. Jealousy can make people do ugly things and mix that in with her pure barbaric nature, it makes sense that she would choose for him to stop living versus living with someone else. Mourning would be easier than seeing the person you love happy with another, which is clear by the ways she describes her thoughts and turmoil over the situation.",Seminar
I believe the King would be upset that the rules of his arena were broken. But,Seminar
"But I think he would also revel in the fact that his daughter could be so barbaric. However, he does seem to hold the random chance of fate of the arena in the highest regard so although he loves his daughter above all else I think he may make an example of her. Especially if the people found out what happened",Seminar
"Just realized I never answered the second question. I also agree that while the king may feel a bit of pride for his daughter, he holds his beliefs in his chance of fate style of justice so closely to his chest, so he most likely made an example out of his daughter as well.",Seminar
Hey Ashley Peterson! I also wanted to mention the story mention the King's barbaric nature numerous times so it is highly likely that he would punish his daughter.,Seminar

I think she sends him to to the tiger. She could live with his death but not with him living with another woman.,Seminar
I totally agree.,Seminar
 I think she sends him to the tiger. Its clear she had jealousy issues and she was raised by a father that is erratic and delivers justice according to a whim. I dont think she would think reasonably.,Seminar
"As for part 2 of the question...I think the father upon finding out what the daughter had done would totally subvert the natural order of things and not have her go through the process of justice that others do. He would be furious with her and would punish her in some way but, not by putting her in the arena. I dont think he could cope with her dying by the tiger or being forced to marry a person below her royal status.",Seminar
"I agree, ",Seminar
I don't think the father would put his daughter through the same system of justice. I wonder if he would even be all the upset though - because either way he is rid of the man causing him problems - either to death or to be married off to someone else.,Seminar
I think he would be upset...even just for the fact that her behavior is a bad reflection on him. He sounds very narcissistic so I dont know if he would feel real love for his daughter but her behavior and a public trial would bruise his ego. That in itself would be enough for him to brush her crimes under the carpet.,Seminar
That's true -,Seminar
 but maybe he's the only one who knows what she did?,Seminar
"Part 1: What Happens next...I believe in love overall.  I believe she chose to love him by giving him life and happiness.  This is what love truly is.  The story describes her as jovial.  Although her father appears quite selfish, he adores her which means she has seen true love.  So, out comes the lady.",Seminar
"I agree with Anne Marie and Rachel, ",Seminar
"despite the consistent behavior and system of punishment, I do not think the king would send his daughter to the arena. The story tells us that she is the apple of his eye  and that she is above all what his heart cares for.  I do not think he could bear losing her or watching her give love to anyone but him.  I fear the father would punish her by keeping her with him for the rest of her life.  Going to the arena would be too much punishment for him.",Seminar
"This is such an unfortunate story. It looks to me that no matter the choice, all parties will be unhappy. I'd like to think that even though she did inherit some of her dad's fury, she would still try to give her lover a chance and not pick the door with the tiger.

...,Seminar
"Part 1
I believe that the lady will be behind the doors. I think that the Princess loved her lover too much to allow him to be eaten by the Tiger. She would rather see him out and about the kingdom happy with someone else then torn into pieces by the tiger.  However, I am a divorced mom of two kids and my interpretation might be a little off, since I always wanted and are still looking for that fairy tale kind of ending. The one where true love exists no matter what the couple faces.

I believe that when the King discovers that his daughter had broken the law by finding out what was behind the door and then signaling to her lover which one to open, he would be in infuriated. The story stated that he was extremely close to the Princess and resented her se ret relationship.  I believe that if the Princess saved her lover from the tiger, he would retry him and put a tiger behind both doors. The Story stated that the King was barbaric in nature so I feel he would make the Princess ",Seminar
att,Seminar
Part 1  I believe that the tiger is behind the door.  I think the princess is barbaric and can't stand the thought of her lover with another.,Seminar
Part 1  I believe the tiger will be behind the door.  I think the princess is barbaric and won't be able to stand her lover with another.,Seminar
Part 2  I believe that the king will punish his daughter.  I'm not sure how.  I think it depends on whether the tiger or the woman comes out of the door.  Perhaps he might even make her choose a door.,Seminar
I believe she sent him to the tiger.  A king's daughter would not want to share a lover or see him with another woman.,Seminar
Part 2:  I don't think the King will do anything to the Princess.  He knows both choices would be punishment for her and her lover.,Seminar
"In addition, I was surprised the lover so quickly chose the right door after the princess signaled him.  He was willing to accept the fate that she chose.  I wonder if he knew what her choice would be.  I still don't think she would allow him to marry another, although that would be the choice I would make if I was in her shoes.",Seminar
"Part 1: If she loves him, the princess will lead her lover to the door that will allow him to live. If she allows greed and envy to cloud her judgement, she will likely lead her lover to his death.",Seminar
"Part 2: If the King is unbiased, he will treat her like any other person who had broken the law.",Seminar
"I found myself conflicted for the princess. I always want a happy ending of some kind in the stories I read. However, it seems the princess loses either way in this story. If I were in her place, I would have allowed him to marry the woman rather than have him die a painful and bloody death.",Imaginative Entry
"As for the King, he will likely send his daughter to face the same punishment as her lover. As a King, he should treat all lawbreaking the same. However, I wonder if he will crack and pull the same trick that the princess had with her lover or if he will remain firm with his decision.",Seminar
"Part 1: I think that she guided him to the tiger. She was already jealous, and if she couldn't have him, then no one should.",Seminar
"Part 2: Her father gets extremely upset with her for signaling her lover behind his back. He then forgives her because she has proven to be as strong as the rest of her family. Understanding that if she can't have him, no else can't either.",Seminar
I completely agree with you,Seminar
 in being conflicted by happily ever after and greed. I chose the tiger behind the door because the story paints her out to be extremely jealous and barbaric.,Seminar
"It depends upon where the author wants to take the story. Given the princess's stealth and cunning in find out what was behind each door, I think she would rather see her lover dead than alive.",Seminar
"I agree with you Lillian Flores about it depending on someone, but I feel that it is up to the person reading the story and reflecting on the actions of the characters. In this case, the princess was jealous of the girl and she was also semi-barbaric like her father, so I feel she would have chosen the door with the tiger for the man. If I go with my own emotions, even though the author said not to base it on that, I would think that the princess would make the right choice with the right door and let him marry the man.  Although, would the man trust the princess enough and choose the same door as she indicated? So behind the right door would be the tiger.  They are both semibarbaric, so the King would most likely be disappointed at first, but either way, he got what he wanted and that was to keep his daughter away from this man. In this case, either sentence would be justice in his eyes.",Seminar
Marry the girl not the man.,Seminar
"Hi Anne Lee. Yes, the reader will certainly bring her or his background and ideas to the story. And the king did indeed get what he wanted. Good points!",Seminar
"I agree with both of you. To me, it is more likely that the princess would tell the man to open the door to the tiger. There was no mention of the princess questioning the morality of sending him to his death. In fact, it appeared like she was leaning towards it as the more merciful option because he would have a quick death and then be waiting for her in the afterlife. I think if she was going to send him to the other lady, she would have shown more guilt over the option of the tiger.",Seminar
"As for the second question, I imagine the king would definitely send the princess to her own trial just like her lover. His barbarism is so calculated. He has come up with his perfect judgement system, allowing the accused to choose their own fate and leave it up to chance. I don't think there would be any exception to his system, even his own daughter.",Seminar
Hi everyone! I think what happens next is that the princess let her lover marry the woman. The reason why I think she would do that is because she loves the man (as they had made each other the center of each others universe) and she would rather see him alive then feel guilty that she is the reason why he dies (she had nightmares of her lover being killed by the tiger). The king represent determinism and barbarism by having chance dictate one's choice (which he had demonstrated in the arena.)  The princess represented free will and progressivism because she actively went out of her way to know which door held which. I do not think a good lover will put harm's way to their love ones. The princess lost the man regardless of which door she choose but at least she can fulfill her role as a lover to never put harms way in his direction and not let the barbaric nature from her father's bloodline to overcome her moral compass.,Seminar
"Yes, I understand the princess hated the to-be-bride but I just can't see the princess letting her lover die when she went to find out which door led to what. Don't you guys think that symbolize the progressive nature of the princess compared to the king's barbarism where the king rather let chance decide than free will? I think the moral of the story is that we can inherit bad and good traits from one's parents but when it comes to determining who we are as a character, our actions tells more than genetics (as the princess has done when she sought info for the doors rather than let her lover relied on chance at the arena).",Seminar
"As for the 2nd part of the discussion, I don't think the king will ever hurt his daughter as it was mentioned in the story that she is the apple of his eye. I could see him scolding at the princess and put restrictions on her as punishment. In the story, it was implied that the princess is cunning and intelligent so I would suspect she can use her intelligence to calm down her father by appealing to his emotional side since the king is the barbaric one.  I could also see the princess twisting her father's logic that it is fate/chance that the princess has to break the law because if it  was really chance that determines all actions, then chance would had not let the princess not break the law (I hope that makes sense).",Seminar
*would not let the princess break the law in the first place.,Seminar
"As for the King, I believe his system works and would put her through the same system because he fully believes in it. Not sure he wouldn't make sure what door the lion would be in and send her to the man of his choice. He is semibarbaric but loves his daughter and what better justice than marrying her with someone of his choice. Interesting ideas everyone...good job. :)",Seminar
"Hi Rebecca Perez, I think you make an excellent point regarding the Princess representing progressivism and the Kind representing determinism. I believe that the Princess displayed qualities of progressivism from the very beginning; she choose who to love on her own accord which proves that she believes in free will and the importance of making your own decisions in life. With that being said, this is this very reason that I believe she sends her lover to the door of the tiger; she obviously believes in free will, but she still has semi-barbaric tendencies which may cause her to put her own free will above everyone else's.",Seminar
"When the King discovers that his daughter has broken the law, I believe he would most likely make an exception for her. In the story it stated that the King put the love for his  therefore I highly doubt he would send her into the arena. Because of the King views himself and his daughter as royalty, I would speculate that he would come up with an  alternate punishment for his daughter . daughter above all of humanity"" and that she was the ""apple of his eye",Seminar
"My first thought was that the Princess would send her lover to the tiger (because she is like her father and seems to spend a lot more time dwelling on what would happen if he chose the door with the lady than what would happen if he got the tiger), but Michelle makes a good point - that she represents free will in opposition to her father (by finding out what was behind each door). I do think that a lot of this story rests in what the reader brings to it - whether the reader thinks that the Princess would send her lover to death or give him a life without her, depends upon the reader's perception of the world and of the context of the story, rather than just the story itself. Now, I do think that the King would alter the punishment for her daughter when he finds out that she broke the law, simply because he loves her so much and I don't think he would send her to the arena (although I think that would make a more interesting story in my opinion).",Seminar
"I think that she sends her lover to another woman. Even though the thought of him being with someone else is devastating, I don't think she could handle knowing that she  I was secretly hoping that the Princess would find a way to be the woman behind the door that I can't see her just setting him up to die! I think that the King would put his daughter through the system caused his death. I agree with the idea that we will all bring our own ideas to how we interpret the story; I have always been a Disney fantasyland"" sort of girl- true love conquers all and all that other stuff. But she took such a risk to love him  even if that meant changing his rules about who could court his daughter. As I was reading the story  defying her father and choosing true love over being a princess!""",Seminar
"Ana, I agree with you that the king is so adamant that his system is perfect that he would subject his daughter to it. I think he is somewhat blinded by his own importance, and feels that as king he should also be in charge of everyone's fate.  because if he truly loved her he would not have sent the one man that she loved into the arena. He would have moved mountains to make her happy",Seminar
"Part One: The lover picks the door which the Princess indicates, and the beautiful courtier is revealed. The Princess grappled with her thoughts and instincts, feeling jealous and thinking about sending her lover to his death rather than see him with another woman.  She ended up indicating the door which held the beautiful woman because she realized that she couldn't live with the knowledge that she had sent her lover to his ruin.  Deciding that she would rather see him alive, she shows him which door to pick.",Seminar
"Part Two:  I believe the King would send his daughter to the tribunal, because even though he loves her and she is the apple of his eye, he is illustrated to be set in his ways.  He would not make an exception for her because he feels that he needs to establish his power over the citizens of the kingdom.  If he subjects his daughter to the same punishment, then he is proving his stance and making an example of her to his kingdom.  I believe she would find a way to outwit the King, maybe with the help of her lover who she granted life to in part one.",Seminar
"I think she tells him to go to the right but he goes to the left, finding the lady behind the door. In that moment realizes that she led him to his death. The Princess then has to face the fact that he found out she would rather see him dead than with the lady.",Seminar
"Although the King is one that like to follows the rules and has a very barbaric side, he doesn't send his daughter to the tribunal. Instead he makes her live with the agony of living without her love and while facing the fact of her character.",Seminar
"Part One: The princess seemed more threatened and bothered by the image of her lover going into the arms of another, than by the image of a tiger tearing him apart. I don't remember her exact words, but she thinks him dying quickly if the tiger is behind the door is a better fate for him. I'm not a fan of the barbaric ancestry and tendencies this text brings up, but it seems to be given as the reason for the King and Princess to act cruel and savagely. Therefore, I do think that that behind the door the Princess motioned to is the tiger. The story reads to me as if the Princess would rather have her lover to herself in perpetuity (in her mind) by killing him off now instead of see him with someone else.",Seminar
"Part One con't: Oops, sent the rest before finishing this thought. I think the lover goes to the door on the left instead of the door on the right, thinking on her barbaric"" nature and that she'd likely betray him  and finds a lady instead of the tiger. I'm assuming even though he knows her  it would leave him in shock knowing that the Princess would want him dead if she cannot keep him to herself.""",Seminar

The King thinks himself fair and seems to care a great deal about maintaining his just"" rule and appearance. I do think that even if he loves his daughter",Seminar
"Part 1: I think that the princess will choose the door with the lady because even though she is jealous of her beauty, in the end she knows her lover loved her and could not live with the pain of killing her love. I also believe that the lover trusts her and chooses the door she picks, leaving him alive and married to the other lady.",Seminar
"Part 2: I believe that the king will not make an example of his daughter for the kingdom, as this would display a bad reputation for the royal family. Instead, I believe the king will keep the knowledge of his daughter's crime to himself with the knowledge that he sent her love on a different path and she can no longer have him.",Seminar
"Hello Helen Howard, I agree with your thoughts on the decision for part 1, but I don't believe the king would amplify the mistakes of his daughter by sending her to the tribunal as it would make the royal family look bad in the eyes of the public if everyone knew of her crimes.",Seminar
"I enjoyed reading all of your perspectives.  Nicole Gonzalez- I also found the idea of barbarism"" kind of unsettling... I guess it was a pretty common theme in story telling in the ""old  but reading from my 21st century perspective days""  it feels like labeling the society as ""other"" or ""bad"".""",Seminar
Hi Helen Howard! I feel this text is meant to unsettle in a way. It wasn't just the barbarism but also the mention of ancestry and blood that made me think it was fatalistic in a way. Kind of like the King and Princess were destined to act in cruel ways. I'm glad that someone else picked up on it too and I really liked your point that it does feel labeling a society in sweeping terms.,Seminar
"Part one: I think the lover follows the Princess's instructions and opens the door on the right to the tiger. Based on how the Princess is described as barbaric"" like her father  I think the King sends his daughter into the tribunal as well.

"Hi Kathryn Bell! I am curious to know why you think the lover would not follow the princess's instructions to open the door on the right? While the princess definitely felt untrustworthy to me, I did not get a sense that the lover felt that from her.",Seminar
"Part 1:  I believe that the Princess indicated for her lover to choose the door with the other lady behind it, because her love for him was strong.  Her relationship with him wasn't only passionate feelings, but truly a deep love, that is why it pained the Princess so much to think of her lover with another woman.  I believe that the young man trusted the Princess, because he knew her very well.  He knew that she would defy her father and find the answer to save him.  That's why he looked to her for help.  They knew each other very well.",Seminar
"Part 2:  I believe that the King made his daughter face her fate in the King's arena.  The King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena.  The King didn't care whether or not his daughter would be traumatized by the event.  By sending his daughter's lover to the arena, he proved that he cared more about his own rules than the happiness and well-being of his family.  The King was more barbaric than civilized and he was very set in his ways.",Seminar
"Hello Sandra Coleman, I think it's a good point you made that the King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena. It does seem that when he caught them, it was immediately understood that the lover would have to put his life on the line. For that reason and his barbaric nature that is quoted a lot, I also believe he would make his daughter face her fate in the King's arena.",Seminar
"Part 1: I believe that he chooses the door that the Princess gives him the hint to choose. When he opens the door, the lady is there because the Princess has love that very strong for him. She knows that she would rather know that he is alive and happy than send him to his end.",Seminar
"Part 2: With how the King wants to assert his power over his kingdom and people, I believe he would make an example out of his daughter and send her to same fate as her lover. He didn't take her feelings about her lover into consideration so that shows how brutal his mind and rule is.",Seminar
Part 1: I think the princess hints to him the door with the lover. She is described as only semi barberous and so by having her show mercy to her former lover she provides a foil of free will to the Barbarous Kings fate based judicious system.,Seminar
Part 2:I think the king has to send his daughter to the ring. She has broken the rules like anyone else and so as someone who has put their trust in fate he would subject his daughter to the same punishment. Ultimately I think he would believe that she would prevail in hist justice system.,Seminar
"Hi Teresa Stewart, I felt that if he truly knew her, he would know her true character and her barbaric side. The story also noted that she had seen her lover talk to the lady before, and assumed that her jealousy would be known to him prior to his tribunal.",Seminar
"I feel that with the personalities traits provided to both the king and princess, she decided that death would be more appropriate than another woman, a rival, living happily with her lover. The princess was already wavering with deciding if he was faithful, so why would she give him and her rival the satisfaction? The lion seems to be the only choice for her disposition and upbringing.",Seminar
"Part 2: With the events led, created, and executed by the king, one would believe he would send his daughter to the arena as she has committed a crime, embarrassed the king, and went against the rules. He is semi-barbaric so he will probably feel guilt as the story states he loves his daughter, but he is also king. He wants to keep in power and with these events, shows his power to rule over life and death. His character would choose fame, power, and glory over love as with these events, sympathy is not a strong theme in this story.",Seminar
"Hi Douglas Jackson, I like your point in Part 1 about semi barbarous but I feel she showed her mercy in dwelling on the issues day and night, losing sleep, and imagining both scenarios. The readers feels the guilt she portrays, but in the end I believe with her being the daughter of the king who created this judicial system, and growing up around these barbarous events, she sent him into the lions den - literally!",Seminar
I have never heard this story before... and I was wondering if it is some kind of folk tale?  Has anyone else seen this story before and do you know what culture it is from?,Seminar
Hi Helen Howard! I actually had the same question as I had never heard this story before. So I did some research! This short story was written by Frank Stockton in 1882. Stockton wrote a follow up to this story called The Discourager of Hesitancy. He seems to like open-ended stories like these.,Seminar
"Thanks for the info and research, I was wondering about this story as well. I've never read it before.",Seminar
In part one I think he chose the princess because of her hints.  In part two she broke the rules so the king must be true to his role as leader and must trust fate and deal with his daughter how he would anyone else.,Seminar
"Hello Emily James I agree with your rational regarding part 2. The king would lose respect and his reputation if he did not deal with her in the same way as others. I agree he will feel guilty and I'm sure it was difficult, but again he needs to save face.",Seminar
"Hello everyone, can you see this?",Social
This is Natalie. I can't wait to get this activity started,Social
Hello! I can!,Social
"I know, I've been waiting my the computer",Social
Hi Katie!,Social
*by,Social
"Hello, Natalie!",Social
I can't see when people are online but I can see that you've checked the book recently,UX
I can't see anyone either unless they write a message.,UX
"I just asked Samantha if this activity is timed or if we need to spend a certain amount of time in the chat, Samantha said we can take as long as we want",Procedure
"Okay, cool! Should we wait a couple of minutes for Rebecca or get started?",Social
Sure let's wait,Social
I don't think this e-book times out so we should be ok,UX
Okay!,Social
"it says Alexandrea, Matthew and Sara looked at this 18 days ago. How is this possible? I thought the activity just opened up this week?",UX
Hello! I've been on but just noticed the chat feature. We're good to get started :),UX
So did I. Do you think they are in another course?,UX
"Oh, hi Rebecca!",Social
Okay Hi Rebecca and Katie,Social
"So regarding part 1 of the question, I think the lady is behind the door!",Seminar
That's what I thought to or how I interpreted the ending,Seminar
"If she really loves him, she should want him to be with someone else and alive rather than dead!",Seminar
Did you guys already read the story? It won't move past the part of four questions for me.,UX
"What about you, Rebecca?",Seminar
It was strange because it seems the daughter is jealous of the lady behind the door. so its an interesting twist,Seminar
"Oh, sorry! Yes I read it",Seminar
"Rebecca, it was a bit glitchy with me at times and I refreshed and logged back in",UX
"Oh yeah Rebecca, in order to get past page 8, you have to form 5 questions with the tiles on bottom of screen",UX
Hint I _____him?,UX
then click submit,UX
I tried to read it before 7 but it's stuck on that one part,UX
then click on the checkmark button,UX
I had to ask my spouse for help,Social
head in hands,Social
"Oh, yeah! You make up the questions and then can advance!",UX
"Yeah I put questions, I'll refresh and try again",UX
"Each time you submit, the lady talks back to you and her icon changes.",UX
Hm it's still not working. Sorry guys I'm trying,UX
Which browser did you use?,UX
It took me 10 tried. Then I got it,UX
It doesn't matter the combo of the questions,UX
I'm in google chrome,UX
"Yes, it has to be chrome or firefox",UX
"Ok it's finally working. I'll read the next part quickly and then I'll be good to keep going. Sorry guys, thanks for your help",UX
No worries!,Social
"Okay, I agree, I think the lady is behind the door.",Seminar
"So it definitely seems like the princess hates the lady behind the door. But if it were me, I couldn't stand to see the man I love being eaten by a tiger.",Seminar
Do you think the lady is more beautiful than the princess?,Seminar
I'm not sure. They're probably equally beautiful and just jealous :),Seminar
ha ha,Social
"I think it is entirely possible for the tiger to be behind the door, as the story indicates that she is jealous of the lady and she has a barbaric spirit like her father. However, as Katie said, I don't think she could have watched the tiger eat him if she loved him so much. Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.",Seminar
"Well said, Rebecca",Seminar
Good point you made Rebecca,Seminar
"Regarding part 2 of the question, what do you think the king does to his daughter?",Seminar
I think the king would subject her to the same law as everyone else and expect her fate to be decided in the arena.,Seminar
Since he's barbaric...maybe he puts her in the ring to face her own doors? :(,Seminar
"Okay, me too! Sorry there's a bit of a delay on my end.",UX
"If he knew his daughter truly loved that man but sent him to the arena because of his barbaric nature, I don't think he would extend any grace to his daughter, even though the story told us that he treasures her.",Seminar
That's what I thought as well. I remember the description of the King being barbaric with his punishments and I think he would put his daughter in front of the doors as well,Seminar
Yep.,Social
"Do you think that the king would be tempted to do the same thing she did, though, and find out which door was which?",Imaginative Entry
I could be wrong but I think the daughter's door opened up to being with her lover?,Seminar
There appears to be descriptions of her seeing her lover's face?,Seminar
"Not really, no. Considering they mention how barbaric he is. I feel like he's a by-the-book sort of guy",Seminar
That was in response to Rebecca's question.,Seminar
"Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie?",Seminar
"Yeah, did they actually put the King's daughter in the arena in the story?",Seminar
"Yeah, I think you're right. But it would be interesting if her lover ended up being behind the door she chose. Although I think the story said that it was people in the king's court that decide who goes behind the door, not the king.",Seminar
So I'm not sure if the king would've had a hand in putting her lover behind the door.,Seminar
"But it would be interesting if the princess's actions in breaking the law made her father realize just how much she loved the man (if she did tell him of the door with the lady). So maybe he could've used his influence to put her lover behind the door, that way he could still abide by his own law but also extend love to his daughter.",Seminar
I honestly found the writing style in the story kind of confusing?,Seminar
Anyone else?,Seminar
Me too I had to reread the first couple pages several times before I understood what was going on.,Seminar
Same.,Seminar
"Natalie, are you still there?",Social
I guess that was all we had to do? I don't know if there's anything else to discuss,Procedure
"Okay, cool",Social
"Thanks, everyone!",Social
Enjoy the wedding!,Social
Thanks for hopping on for a little bit! I hope you both have a great rest of this semester!,Social
"Thank you, I will!! :)",Social
Thank you! You too!,Social
Hi sorry ladies I got kicked off,UX
Sorry just getting to everyone's messages,Social
I also found the story confusing and I had to re-read it several times,Seminar
I guess the ending depends on how everyone interprets it,Seminar
anyways have a good night,Social
and a wonderful semester thanks for hopping on,Social
Enjoy the wedding Katie,Social
Goodnight!,Social
I'm so sorry to have missed this initial conversation. I was dealing with some personal matters that prevented me from doing so. But I've caught up and I greatly enjoyed reading the discourse here.,Social
I had similar issues reading the writing style. It took a few times to really get to the core of what was being said.,Seminar
Based on the princess' description I had almost expected her to not make any motion towards the door. I assumed she would take the same 'let Fate decide' attitude as the king,Seminar
"I certainly hoped that she was steering her lover away from the tiger, but can see how she would not want to see him with another woman based on the jealousy discussed above.",Seminar
"Though, I do think it would have been particularly interesting to see her point him to the tiger, just for the tiger to not eat him by some stroke of luck. Perhaps the universe truly showing that the innocent go unpunished in this king's model of justice",Seminar
I definitely agree with all of you stating that the king likely would subject his daughter to the same form of judgement in the arena if her actions were discovered.,Seminar
"Whether or not the princess 'saved' him away from the tiger, she interferred and the kind would not allow that.",Seminar
I apologize again that I couldn't be part of the original discussion. It was clearly productive and I'm disappointed to have missed out on the opportunity.,Social
P1: I believe the tiger is behind the door.,Seminar
"P2: I believe the king would send his daughter to the arena too. Given his barbaric nature. However, he too may indicate which door the tiger waits behind.",Seminar
"I think the lady is behind the door. She will lose him, but she does not want to see him die.",Seminar
"P2: The king may send his daughter to the arena, but he will not allow her to die, so he puts a man of his choosing behind the door for her to marry. He signals to her to choose that door.",Seminar
"I have no guess as to which is behind the door. Is it unclear weather or not she is even instructing him to choose the door on the right side. She could have raised her right hand to signal ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT go in that door, the tiger is there.‚Äù",Seminar
"Part 2: The daughter is ‚Äúthe apple of the king‚Äôs eye‚Äù, therefore, I believe he will not disclose this knowledge to anyone. This would save her from a trial.",Seminar
"Part 1: Honestly hard to say, though I'd like to believe she spared the one she loved. That said, If she is as barbaric as her father, she could very well have sent him to his death. If she can't have him, no one can.",Seminar
"Part 2: The king most certainly spares his daughter, one way or another. She is his greatest pride. I say he puts on a show for the people to act as though the law is being upheld, but behind the doors are suiters of his choosing. He keeps his daughter safe and she has to marry someone he believes is the best choice for her.",Seminar
"Hello, here are my thoughts on the two questions. Part 1: Because I believe she does indeed love him, I think that she directs him to the door with the lady. My reasoning is that love would prevent her from being responsible for his death. Part 2: Based on what we know about the king, I think it's likely he would be quite upset and consider putting his own daughter to the same fate as her lover. Her breaking the rules is a huge blow to his ego, and it doesn't seem as though he is the type to let that sort of this slide, even if it's his daughter's life on the line. Plus, if he doesn't apply the same rules to her as the rest of his subjects, the laws his entire kingdom are based upon are at risk. I just don't see him as being able to get past all that, so I think she would face the two doors like everyone else.",Seminar
Hi all. Jennifer here.,Social
Hello!,Social
Hiya!,Social
I think we're just waiting for Ellery?,Social
"Yeah, I think so.",Social
If she hasn't log in yet she may still need to read the story.,Procedure
"Hi, sorry was trying to find the right area.",UX
Okay. While we're waiting what did you think of the story? I anticipated being bored but I thought it was actually pretty interesting.,Deliberation
"Of course, I had to keep pulling my dictionary out! :-D",Social
I feel like I've read it before,Seminar
It took me a bit to get invested because it seemed unnecessarily wordy.,Seminar
"Yes, I have heard it told better.",Seminar
I agree that the first page was really wordy and lots of unfamiliar vocabulary,Seminar
I think this is a good story to find out your human nature.,Imaginative Entry
Should we start with part 1 by saying what each of us believes will happen next and why?,Deliberation
"I agree, Ellery.",Seminar
"It could go either way, can the woman allow her lover to live with another or end the pain quickly with the tiger.",Seminar
So do we want to go he opened the door to the lady or the tiger?,Seminar
Sounds good,Seminar
"I guess I'm a skeptic. I thought because the princess is the ‚Äúfervent and imperious‚Äù daughter of a ‚Äúsemi-barbaric king,‚Äù she directed the young man to the tiger door. I figured her imperiousness would not allow her to accept the man she loves marrying another woman and her semi-barbarism would make it easier for her to accept his death.",Seminar
Did we want to look at both of those points.,Deliberation
"Jennifer, I agree with that.",Seminar
"I agree with Jennifer, think from the story it would be best to end it quick with the Tiger.",Seminar
Especially when she started thinking about if she'd seen the lady flirting with the man beforehand,Seminar
And then throw the king into the ring for his just desserts.,Seminar
"As much as I would wish it was the lady, I'd agree Jennifer the princess sounds like she'd rather him die than not be with her",Seminar
oooo ellery,Social
That's definitely a twist!,Seminar
"I agree, Alexandra. You know that old saying, 'hell has no wrath like a woman scorned.'",Seminar
In any of the instructions did it mention how much we're supposed to write for the answer? Like just a couple sentences or does it need to be longer?,Deliberation
It would be an ongoing pain for the lady to watch her lover with another woman.,Seminar
What is part one on the left? Is that the rest of the story?,UX
No direction on length. Maybe a paragraph for each part?,Deliberation
"Yeah, my grammar is atrocious so feel free to fix me lol",Seminar
It looks like it is a shared document so anyone can add to it,Deliberation
"Oh, nice edit",Deliberation
Anyone want to take the lead on part 2?,Deliberation
"Should the part about the king go in part 2? Because initially he doesn't know that she's guiding the man, right?",Deliberation
I think 1 looks pretty good!,Deliberation
The king part looks like it would be after the event,Seminar
"Thank you for typing that Caitlin. I am so not a good creative writer. I would've been like, 'the door he opened had the tiger and the lover died.'",Seminar
Are we planning on offing the King?,Deliberation
Not a problem at all! Thanks whomever added to it and proofed me1,Social
I say say we kill the king.  Long live the Queen (Princess)!,Seminar
DEATH TO THE KING!,Seminar
"Ellery, that's an interesting question. How do you think we could off him since he's the king?",Imaginative Entry
"The story states that ‚Äúnothing pleased him so much as to make the crooked straight and crush down uneven places.‚Äù I take that to mean justice is of high value to him. However, it is also stated that his daughter was ‚Äúthe apple of his eye, and was loved by him above all humanity.‚Äù I guess when it comes down to it, I think the king would put his daughter in the ring and let impartial justice be served.",Seminar
I'm good with that. Could it be that the King decides to try and put the princess in the ring but she's more loved by the people and can get the crowds to turn on the King?,Seminar
I got carried away sorry!,Seminar
I don't like how you have to scroll to see chats,UX
"Yeah, this system isn't the easiest to use. It's also not convenient that you can't look at the original story and have the chat open at the same time.",UX
yeah this could have been coded better.,UX
"Caitlin, I like how you ended the story!",Seminar
"Yeah that was sweet, ended at just the right time to leave the rest to the imagination.",Seminar
"I agree with those assessments of the chat functions. It'd be helpful to be able to see the story while discussing it. I'm good with your ending, Caitlin!",UX
I think it fits both their personalities: the kings desire for justice and the daughter's imperiousness and barbarism.,Seminar
Agreed,Seminar
yay! Thank you!,Social
My love of dystopian sci-fi has paid off!,Social
LOL!,Social
"No, thank you Caitlin for taking the lead on this.",Social
"I second that. Thanks, Caitlin!",Social
"Yeah, thank you! It's definitely way more creative than I could've done. I just made a few edits here and there on it.",Seminar
Not a problem at all!,Social
Anything else we need to discuss before we submit it?,Deliberation
I think I'm good,Deliberation
I don't have anything else to discuss with it.,Deliberation
I think we covered everything.,Deliberation
Did we submit it? Is that why it's blank now?,UX
Did all of the text just disappear from the left?,UX
its back again,UX
thank goodness it's back!!,UX
Oops. That may have been me. I copied and pasted it into a word document so I had it for my records. I just pasted it back. Sorry...didn't mean to freak anyone out.,UX
It says to add the title submitted and thats it,Deliberation
"Jennifer, I almost died lol",Social
Great. It was so nice to work with a group where everyone participates. Thank you so much for being such a fantastic group to work with!!,Social

"Part 1: Unfortunately, I think the tiger was behind the door to the right. The author built up her character to be someone who is power hungry. The author also added that the princess despised the woman who is behind the door to the left and that she was jealous of the minimal friendship her lover and the woman had.",Seminar
"Part 2: Even though the King loves his daughter very much, I think he will still have her stand trial similarly to everyone else. He may feel betrayed that she went behind his back. He also didn't take her feelings into account when he put her lover on trial, so why would he now?",Seminar
"Part 1: I also believe the tiger is behind the door. Based on what we have read of the princess and her character, I think she would rather see her lover die that see him with the woman she despises so much.",Seminar
"Part 2: I think that the King will be forced to have his daughter stand trial just as he would anyone else. Making an exception for his own daughter would not only make him look bad to his people, it would also open the King up to potential pushback with future trials.",Seminar
Part 1: I tend to agree with Shannon on this part. I also believe the man met the fate of the tiger. It could be said of the Princess that 'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.' She'd rather see her lover slaughtered than see him happily freed and married to a woman whom she was jealous of.,Seminar
"Part 2: I don't feel I have enough information to answer this question. Was anyone besides the King aware of the infraction? I think how the King would respond depends on the nature of the crime and whether or not anyone else was aware of it. It was stated the the King loved his daughter above all of humanity. Although the King was barbaric, ruthless, and power-hungry, he may have spared his daughter. It is plausible that she could have faced the public arena along with her low-ranking lover, as she was as guilty of forbidden love as him. But that did not happen.",Seminar
"Part 1: The simple answer is, who knows?  It could be either the lady or the tiger.  The question posed tries to elicit a response that can only come from the reader‚Äôs own ethical/moral compass.  There is simply not enough information for one to make an informed choice, without imparting one‚Äôs own bias on the scenario.  The questions I would ask?  What does a barbarian world view actually entail?  What was the emotional/mental state of the princess on the day in question?",Seminar
"Part 2: Again, who knows?  If we were to follow down a traditional barbarian world view, the king would probably throw his daughter into the arena.  But again, we reach a philosophical dilemma.  What is the actual barbarian world view?  When ‚Äúshit‚Äù hits your family, does it change (or alter) your world view?  These are dispositions that are solely in the mind of the actor, and can only be witnessed once acted upon.",Seminar
"Hello all! The instructions seem to contradict each other. In the email we received it says 'please DO NOT work on this at the same time. Much like a regular online discussion, you are asked to respond individually to the discussion prompt.' While the prompt inside the program says 'to collaboratively write a response to the prompt. Teammates can coordinate to write & edit here at the same time.' ???",Procedure
"If any of us  were on at the same time, we would be able to prepare a collaborative response in the window to the left.  However, I do not think it is mandatory.",Procedure

"Ok, now I see what we are getting at.. I thought we had to save it on the left. I see now that it stays there for people to add and edit",UX
"Part 1: I assumed that the tiger would be behind the door. The princess is framed as someone who is as barbaric as her father, and she loses her love either way. She may be of the opinion that if she can't have him, then it's better for him to die and not to see him happy with another.",Seminar
This is a very confusing interface....,UX
"Part 2: I assume the king would make her stand trial. I agree with everyone else that he didn't care about her feelings before. Unless there was a twist ending where she puts her father on trial, but I think I'm writing a different story now!",Seminar
This interface is super confusing and the contradictory instructions don't help...,UX
"Hey! The section here to the right is for us to communicate and collaborate, while the space to the left is for our collective response correct?",UX
